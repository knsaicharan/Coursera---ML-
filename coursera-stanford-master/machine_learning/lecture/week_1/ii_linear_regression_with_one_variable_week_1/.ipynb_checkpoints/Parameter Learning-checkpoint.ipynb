    "Suppose your initial value of theta 1 is already at the local minimum. It turns out the local optimum, your derivative will be equal to zero. So for that slope, that tangent point, so the slope of this line will be equal to zero and thus this derivative term is equal to zero. And so your gradient descent update, you have theta one cuz I updated this theta one minus alpha times zero. And so what this means is that if you're already at the local optimum it leaves theta 1 unchanged cause its updates as theta 1 equals theta 1. So if your parameters are already at a local minimum one step with gradient descent does absolutely nothing it doesn't your parameter which is what you want because it keeps your solution at the local optimum. This also explains why gradient descent can converse the local minimum even with the learning rate alpha fixed."
